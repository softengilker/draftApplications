I am keeping my draft projects, small code snippets into this repository.

**SchoolProject**: This is student and lessons tracking web application. Primefaces, JSF and JPA ( EclipseLink ) are used.

**SpringIoFControlSample**: This project illustrates the basic inversion of control mechanism of the spring framework. The examples are coded with both xml and annotation based configuration.

**Algorithms**: Includes my code solutions for the questions in the [Algorithms 4th Editon Book](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).
